<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>UML editor for a software architecure lovers !</h3>

<p>Diagram.io is online UML editor that is oriented to Github.
You could easily create a UML diagram in any modern Browser and commmit it to your repositoy on the GitHub.
<br>
For the local clone of your Github repository you could use Eclipse plug-in which implementes HTTP WebSync API.</p>

<a name="project-values" class="anchor" href="#project-values"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project values:</h3>
<ul class="toggleClass">
    <li><a class="toggleClass"> Minimize the creation time for a UML diagram<br>
    <p>Most of the developers do not create UML diagrams because it takes a lot of time.
       According to our statistics a minimum time for a UML diagram creation is 10 minutes (for existing code).
       It looks really boring especially when you have so nice tools like Eclipse or NetBeans.<br>
       So, WebSync plug-in for Eclipse allows you to extract and filter information about source code and use it for diagrams creation.<br>
       UmlSync + WebSync do not provide an automated diagrams creation because in the most cases they are useless.
       Semi-automated approach allows you to create usefull diagrams in a minimal time (2min)!
    </p></a></li>
    <li><a class="toggleClass"> Integrate diagrams into markdown documentation<br>
    <p>How often do you have to keep 2 instances of diagram: one in XMI or any other custom format and another one in PNG/JPG/SVG ?<br>
       Today, thanks to GitHub all developer could create an online documentation which located in the same repository as code.
       It means that each branch or revision could contain a valid documentation, API, installation guide etc.<br>
       So, the next logical step is to integrate diagrams into markdown documentation !!! <br>
    </p></a></li>
    <li><a class="toggleClass"> Simplify sharing diagrams and documentation with collegues<br>
    <p>You could send the reference on the diagram by the GitHub path, SHA-sum, or GIST item, and it will be available for your collegues:<br>
    <i>http://umlsync.org/github/repos/umlsynco/diagrams/contents/diagrams/ProxyPattern.md</i><br>
    The path structure is absolutely similar to GitHub path except the prefix "http://umlsync.org/github"
    </p></a></li>
    <li><a class="toggleClass"> Snippets - the way to share knowledge<br>
    <p>If you need to explan an internal structure of project/feature/module to the collegues then you could go to the blackboard and start drawing sequence diagrams, components and scheemas.<br>
    OR you could create snippet - the sequence of custom(yours) comments across the code, docs and diagrams.<br>
    You could explain diagram or source code to the collegue and add your <b>text comments</b> for them  
    and finally you could send it to your collegues or save it to the project knowledge base.<br>
    As a result you should not explain again and again the same things and collegues will not come with the questions like: "where is the component which you described on the blackboard ?"<br>
    Snippets tool is really perfect in case of multi-sites development when it is not possible to draw somethig on blackboard at all! <br>
    <br>
    Note: Snippets is not a review tool!
