<p>
Snippet was intended to improve the process of communication with colleagues.<br>
Snippet is the sequence of custom comments along with documentation, diagrams and source code which can be shared with team and saved to the knowledgebase of your project. All you have to do is click on the necessary element and add your comment. Then switch to the next document or diagram and simply add your next comment.

So, that means you can now share your own comments as well as diagrams and documentation with fellow team members and save further edits to the project knowledge database.
