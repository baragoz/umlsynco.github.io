<p>
    The one of the major feature of UmlSync is cross-references support by each element of diagram.
    You could create one or more references for each element and all these references will be available for embedded diagrams too.
    <br><br>
    For example: <br>&gt;You could insert the common platform components overview diagram on the first README.md document.
    <br>&gt;User could click on the concreate UML-component of embedded diagram and switch to the component description page by reference like this "./components/concreate_component.md".
    <br>&gt;The "components/concreate_component.md" document could contain diagram which describes sub-components and user could select subcomponent etc.
    <br><br>
    Thus you could make a smooth transition from a High Level Design of your project to a Low Level Design of concreate module/component/feature.
